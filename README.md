This was completed for The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch project, found here https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and was used as practice with DOM manipulation.

When the page initially loads, a 16x16 grid is shown on screen. The user can "draw" on this grid by mousing over each square. By clicking on the reset button above the grid, the user can change the dimensions of the grid. This will also clear the grid.
